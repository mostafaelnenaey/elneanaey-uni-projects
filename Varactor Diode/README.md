# 📡 Varactor Diode – Concept & Simulation Report

This project explores the behavior and applications of **Varactor Diodes**, also known as variable-capacitance diodes. The report explains how these diodes differ from regular diodes, their physical structure, and how reverse bias voltage affects their capacitance.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The original simulation files for this project were lost. This repository serves as a technical summary and documentation of the work.

## 🧠 What is a Varactor Diode?

A Varactor Diode is a special P-N junction diode designed to operate in **reverse-bias**, where it acts like a **variable capacitor**. The capacitance changes with the applied reverse voltage due to the widening or narrowing of the depletion region, mimicking the dielectric thickness in a physical capacitor.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Reverse-bias operation**
- **Voltage-controlled capacitance**
- Common junction types: **Abrupt** and **Hyperabrupt**

## 📐 Capacitance Equation

The diode’s capacitance \( C \) varies with reverse voltage \( V_R \) as:

\[
C = C_0 / (1 + V_R / V_j)^n
\]

Where:
- \( C_0 \): Capacitance at 0 V
- \( V_j \): Junction potential (~0.6–0.7 V for silicon)
- \( n \): Depends on junction type (0.5 for abrupt, ~0.33 for hyperabrupt)

## 🧪 Simulation Description (Reported)

Although the simulation files are missing, the report describes the following:

### RC Circuit Behavior:
- Varactor diode in reverse bias acts as a capacitor.
- Forms a **high-pass filter** in an RC configuration.

### RLC Tuning Circuit:
- Varactor diodes introduce variable capacitance.
- Resonance frequency can be adjusted electrically.

### RL Circuit Comparison:
- With varactors disconnected, circuit becomes **low-pass filter**.
